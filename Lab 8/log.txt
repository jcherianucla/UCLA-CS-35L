File - log.txt - A file describing the steps taken in the lab and the reasons
behind them.

We first make sure our sort version is up to date which is 8.25.

We begin the lab by creating a file called big with 10,000,000 double
numbers on a new line each. We do this using od (object dump) with the
-tf option for floating point, -N 80000000 for 10,000,000 numbers, since
-N takes the number of bytes, and each double is 8 bytes. We have to
however format it to remove the addresses using sed 's/^[0-7]* *//' to
remove all octal numbers and spaces from the start and then tr from ' '
to '\n' to put it all on newlines.

od -tf -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom | sed 's/^[0-7]* *//' | tr -s ' ' '\n'

We then begin to time the sorting with -g for general number sorting
and send the output to /dev/null and time to time the process.

time -p sort -g big > /dev/null
real 39.35
user 217.14
sys 0.55

time -p sort -g --parallel=1 big > /dev/null
real 188.31
user 188.08
sys 0.23

time -p sort -g --parallel=2 big > /dev/null
real 96.12
user 183.68
sys 0.35

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 big > /dev/null
real 55.85
user 190.70
sys 0.47

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 big > /dev/null
real 35.05
user 195.03
sys 0.60

We see that the general sort and the sort with parallel=8 have around the 
same execution (real) time while the other number of threads have it a
lot slower. There seems to exist no pattern with the user time but we notice
they all stay within 180-220 seconds. We notice the system time increases
as the number of threads increases because the more threads call more syscalls
than fewer threads. This leads us to believe that the default sort as
far as coreutils 8.6 and higher is concerned is multithreaded to the maximum
number of processors available but capped at 8. That is why the general sort
and the 8-threaded sort have similar run times.
